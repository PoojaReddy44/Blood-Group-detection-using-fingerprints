# Blood-Group-detection-using fingerprint
This repository contains the complete source code, datasets, and results related to the project "Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprints". The project explores the innovative application of deep learning models (VGG16-based CNN) to classify a person’s blood group directly from fingerprint images — eliminating the need for traditional invasive blood sampling methods.

The system processes fingerprint images and predicts the corresponding blood group class using a trained model.
